@charset:
    The @charset CSS at-rule specifies the character encoding used in the style sheet.
    It must be the first element in the style sheet and not be preceded by any character;
    as it is not a nested statement, it cannot be used inside conditional group at-rules.
    If several @charset at-rules are defined, only the first one is used,
    and it cannot be used inside a style attribute on an HTML element or inside the <style>
    element where the character set of the HTML page is relevant.

    @charset "utf-8";
    This at-rule is useful when using non-ASCII characters in some CSS properties, like content.

@import:
    The @import CSS at-rule is used to import style rules from other style sheets.
    These rules must precede all other types of rules,
    except @charset rules; as it is not a nested statement,
    @import cannot be used inside conditional group at-rules.

    @import url("fineprint.css") print;
    @import url("bluish.css") speech;
    @import 'custom.css';
    @import url("chrome://communicator/skin/");
    @import "common.css" screen;
    @import url('landscape.css') screen and (orientation:landscape);

@media:
    The @media CSS at-rule can be used to apply part of a style sheet based on the result of one or more media queries.
    The @media at-rule may be placed at the top level of your code or nested inside any other conditional group at-rule.

@keyframes:
    The @keyframes CSS at-rule controls the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by defining styles for keyframes
    (or waypoints) along the animation sequence.
    This gives more control over the intermediate steps of the animation sequence than transitions.
