ReadWriteLock Locking Rules
    The rules by which a thread is allowed to lock the ReadWriteLock either for reading or writing the guarded resource,
    are as follows:

Read Lock   	If no threads have locked the ReadWriteLock for writing,
                and no thread have requested a write lock (but not yet obtained it).
                Thus, multiple threads can lock the lock for reading.
Write Lock   	If no threads are reading or writing.
                Thus, only one thread at a time can lock the lock for writing.

ReadWriteLock readWriteLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
readWriteLock.readLock().lock();
    // multiple readers can enter this section
    // if not locked for writing, and not writers waiting
    // to lock for writing.
readWriteLock.readLock().unlock();
readWriteLock.writeLock().lock();
    // only one writer can enter this section,
    // and only if no threads are currently reading.
readWriteLock.writeLock().unlock();
