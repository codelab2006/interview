The thread pool contained inside the ThreadPoolExecutor can contain a varying amount of threads. 
The number of threads in the pool is determined by these variables:

    corePoolSize
    maximumPoolSize

If less than corePoolSize threads are created in the the thread pool when a task is delegated to the thread pool, 
then a new thread is created, even if idle threads exist in the pool.
If the internal queue of tasks is full, and corePoolSize threads or more are running, but less than maximumPoolSize threads are running, 
then a new thread is created to execute the task.
