CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE

Throughout the documentation, there are references to the two following properties:

    CATALINA_HOME: Represents the root of your Tomcat installation, for example /home/tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.10 or C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-9.0.10.
    CATALINA_BASE: Represents the root of a runtime configuration of a specific Tomcat instance. If you want to have multiple Tomcat instances on one machine, 
                   use the CATALINA_BASE property.

If you set the properties to different locations, the CATALINA_HOME location contains static sources, such as .jar files, or binary files. 
The CATALINA_BASE location contains configuration files, log files, deployed applications, and other runtime requirements.

Why Use CATALINA_BASE

By default, CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE point to the same directory. Set CATALINA_BASE manually when you require running multiple Tomcat instances on one machine. Doing so provides the following benefits:

    Easier management of upgrading to a newer version of Tomcat. Because all instances with single CATALINA_HOME location share one set of .jar files and binary files, 
    you can easily upgrade the files to newer version and have the change propagated to all Tomcat instances using the same CATALIA_HOME directory.

    Avoiding duplication of the same static .jar files.

    The possibility to share certain settings, for example the setenv shell or bat script file (depending on your operating system).
