1. Static Field Holding On to the Object Reference
    public static final ArrayList<Double> list = new ArrayList<Double>(1000000);

2. Calling String.intern() on Long String (string objects are stored in PermGen space)
    Returns a canonical representation for the string object.
    A pool of strings, initially empty, is maintained privately by the class String.
    When the intern method is invoked, if the pool already contains a string equal to this String object
    as determined by the equals(Object) method, then the string from the pool is returned.
    Otherwise, this String object is added to the pool and a reference to this String object is returned.

3. Unclosed Streams

4. Unclosed Connections

5. Adding Objects with no hashCode() and equals() into a HashSet

How to Find Leaking Sources in Your Application
    1. Verbose Garbage Collection
        By adding the -verbose:gc parameter to the JVM configuration of our application
    2. Do Profiling
        The most popular profiler is Visual VM â€“ which is a good place to start moving past
        command-line JDK tools and into lightweight profiling.
